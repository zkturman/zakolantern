                    Reportings from campers and climbers in Fury Gorge have cropped up
                    over the last several decades.

                    Weird shadows in the night, strange calls. Missing people with no bodies ever 
                    found.

                    A recent group discovered evidence of an old settlement at the base of the waterfall, 
                    the Devil's Tongue.

                    You are part of the research group investigating the ruins...

                <p>
                    The only building left from the settlement, an old chapel, seems to be the source of
                    the evil, but can you solve the mystery before time runs out?
